# Use Case Diagram for Airbnb Clone Backend

This use case diagram visualizes the key features and functionalities of the backend for the Airbnb Clone project. It outlines the interactions between different actors (Guest, Host, and Admin) and the system, focusing on core functionalities such as user registration, property management, booking, payments, and reviews.

## Key Actors:
- **Guest**: A user who can search for properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.
- **Host**: A user who can manage property listings, update availability, and handle bookings.
- **Admin**: A system administrator who has control over user management, property listings, and general system monitoring.

## Key Use Cases:
1. **User Registration**: Guests can sign up to create an account.
2. **Login and Authentication**: Users can log in using email/password or OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook).
3. **Property Listings**: Hosts can create, edit, or delete their property listings.
4. **Search for Properties**: Guests can search for properties based on criteria such as location, price, and amenities.
5. **Booking Properties**: Guests can book properties for specified dates and make payments.
6. **Payment Integration**: Guests can pay for their bookings securely using platforms like Stripe or PayPal.
7. **Leave Reviews**: Guests can leave ratings and reviews for properties they’ve stayed in.
8. **Manage Users**: Admins can manage user accounts (guests and hosts).
9. **Manage Listings**: Admins can manage property listings on the platform.

## Diagram Description:
- **Actors** (Guest, Host, Admin) are represented by stick figures.
- **Use cases** (e.g., "Search for Properties", "Manage Listings") are shown as ovals.
- The diagram captures all the critical user interactions with the system, allowing stakeholders to easily understand the flow of the application.

## Purpose:
This diagram is a high-level overview of the system’s functionality and user interactions. It serves as a reference for developers and product managers to ensure that all necessary features are covered in the development process.

## File Location:
- The use case diagram is stored as a PNG file in the `use-case-diagram/` directory.

## How to Use:
To view the diagram, simply download the PNG file from the repository. It is recommended to review it to understand the user flows and the system's core features before proceeding with development.
